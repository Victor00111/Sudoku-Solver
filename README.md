# Sudoku-Solver
To run, make sure that you have the Pygame module installed. I used Pygame 2.4.0 for this project, but any up-to-date version should work.

Also, note that sudoku puzzles can have multiple solutions and the solver only finds one of them. This means that if you are solving your own puzzle, there is a chance the solver may think your solution is wrong even if it is valid.
